Version: 0.2.1
Date: 2020-10-19
  Changes:
    - Added a setting to disable the checking of the inventory before job reassignment
      Those checks should stay on in Auto-Mode, otherwise it's possible that base bots 
      will never arrive and stuff won't be built because of missing items.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2020-10-15
  Features:
    - There's now an "Auto-Mode", that continuously takes over construction jobs.
      It's basically the "Direct Select" mode, but without clicking the button manually.
    - Additional Settings:
      Auto-Mode specific settings to tune how frequent it'll run (every Xth tick; turn up to save UPS)
      and how long it'll wait until it tries another reprioritization (turn up for slower bots)
    - Item request slots for modules and fuel, etc. now work as well!
    - German translation added. Translations are always welcome! Copy the "locale/en/locale.cfg" file
      and send me a translated version if you want to help out :)
  Changes:
    - Renamed operation modes:
      "Selection Tool": Uses a selection tool to start the reprioritization
      "Direct Select": Uses the personal roboport range as selection area
      "Auto-Mode": Same as Direct Select mode, but doing the operation continuously
    - Work orders are only reissued if the player has the material to fullfill the 
      order in their inventory.
  Fix:
    - Circuit connections are now retained

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
