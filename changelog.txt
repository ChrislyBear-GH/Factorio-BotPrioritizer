Version: 0.2.3
Date: ????
  Fix:
    - Fixed a crash in Auto-Mode. Deconstruction proxies don't have a unit_number but are
      LuaEntities nonetheless. Dropped the distinction between tiles and entites and now just look
      if a unit_number is available or not.      
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 2021-01-20
  Changes:
    - Cloning ghosts internally requires a "temporary" surface in 1.1, because ghosts now have
      collision with each other (or something like that). This mod now creates (but doesn't
      generate chunks on) a new empty surface called "clonespace" to be able to make a backup of
      the ghost before destroying and cloning it back to the player's surface.
      TL;DR: It works again in 1.1.

Version: 0.2.1
Date: 2020-10-19
  Changes:
    - Added a setting to disable the checking of the inventory before job reassignment
      Those checks should stay on in Auto-Mode, otherwise it's possible that base bots 
      will never arrive and stuff won't be built because of missing items.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2020-10-15
  Features:
    - There's now an "Auto-Mode", that continuously takes over construction jobs.
      It's basically the "Direct Select" mode, but without clicking the button manually.
    - Additional Settings:
      Auto-Mode specific settings to tune how frequent it'll run (every Xth tick; turn up to save UPS)
      and how long it'll wait until it tries another reprioritization (turn up for slower bots)
    - Item request slots for modules and fuel, etc. now work as well!
    - German translation added. Translations are always welcome! Copy the "locale/en/locale.cfg" file
      and send me a translated version if you want to help out :)
  Changes:
    - Renamed operation modes:
      "Selection Tool": Uses a selection tool to start the reprioritization
      "Direct Select": Uses the personal roboport range as selection area
      "Auto-Mode": Same as Direct Select mode, but doing the operation continuously
    - Work orders are only reissued if the player has the material to fullfill the 
      order in their inventory.
  Fix:
    - Circuit connections are now retained
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.4
Date: 2020-10-10
  Features:
    - Use personal roboport area directly instead of making a selection!
    - Option to use the personal roboport area as selection area; Selection tool is still the default
  Changes:
    - Reassigning deconstruction of tiles added (thanks to Nexela!)
    - Verbosely print results of the reassignment to the player
    - Option to disable these aforementioned messages 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.3
Date: 2020-10-08
  Changes:
    - The built-in function "get_upgrade_target()" is unreliable. Implemented a system to keep
      track of upgrades and upgrade targets based on events.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2
Date: 2020-10-07
  Changes:
    - Changed method to copy items to use built-in LuaEntity.clone() function. Much easier.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2020-10-06

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
