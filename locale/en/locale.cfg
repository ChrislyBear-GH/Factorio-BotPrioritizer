botprio-method=How/when to prioritze:\n[color=#FFE6C0]Selection Tool:[/color] Select entities yourself using a selection box (like blueprints).\n[color=#FFE6C0]Direct Selection:[/color] Automatically select everything in range of your personal roboports.\n[color=#FFE6C0]Auto-Mode:[/color] For the real lazy people! Like the [color=#FFE6C0]Direct Selection[/color], but it'll run every X ticks.
# botprio-use-selection=Use a [color=#FFE6C0]selection[/color] tool instead of selecting everything [color=#FFE6C0]in range of personal roboports[/color] directly.\n[color=#FFE6C0]On[/color]: Use a selection tool to select entities to change priority.\n[color=#FFE6C0]Off[/color]:Change priority of everything in range of the personal roboport.
# botprio-toggling=[color=#FFE6C0]Attention![/color] Option [color=#FFE6C0]ONLY[/color] works if [color=#FFE6C0]NOT[/color] using the selection tool.)\nMakes the Bot Prioritization toggleable, so you can just run around and snag construction orders left and right for your personal robots.
botprio-toggling-time=Time in seconds until prioritization will be retried in [color=#FFE6C0]Auto Mode[/color].\nSet to higher values if your bots are slower, set to lower values for if your bots are fast.
botprio-toggling-frequency=Prioritize every [color=#FFE6C0]X[/color] ticks.\nHere you can set [color=#FFE6C0]how often[/color] the Prioritization in [color=#FFE6C0]Auto Mode[/color] is performed when it's toggled on.
botprio-disable-msg=Disables the messages in chat about the result of the work order reassignment.
botprio-no-inv-checks=Disables the checking of the inventory before trying to reassign work orders.\n[color=#FFE6C0]Attention![/color] Inventory checks should NOT be disabled in Auto-Mode, otherwise it's possible that base bots will never arrive and stuff won't be built because of missing items.
